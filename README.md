# Enhancing Manufacturing Process Quality for Clay Roof Tiles  
### A DMAIC Data-Driven Approach at The Star Tile Works Ltd.

---

## üîé Project Overview  
This project was completed as part of my MSc in Operational Research. The goal was to identify critical defects in clay roof tile manufacturing at The Star Tile Works Ltd., analyze their causes using data-driven quality tools, and recommend process improvements based on the DMAIC methodology.

---

## üéØ Objective  
To systematically reduce defects in the tile production process by applying Statistical Quality Control tools, multi-criteria decision methods, and Six Sigma techniques, leading to measurable improvement in process sigma level and quality consistency.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  
| Framework / Tool                       |                       Purpose                                  |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DMAIC**                              | Overall process improvement structure                          |
| **Pareto Chart**                       | Identify top defect contributors                               |
| **Control Charts**                     | Analyze process variation                                      |
| **Cause & Effect Diagram**             | Identify root causes                                           |
| **AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process)**   | Prioritize defect categories and improvement factors           |
| **QFD (Quality Function Deployment)**  | Translate customer/quality needs into technical specifications |

## üßæ Key Findings

### AHP/QFD Priority Scores

**Raw Material Defects** -- Stage 1
| Defect Type         | Priority |
|---------------------|----------|
| Huge Stones          | 0.45 |
| Roots                | 0.45 |
| Metal Particles      | 0.10 |

**Processing Defects** -- Stage 2
| Defect Type  | Priority |
|--------------|----------|
| Dent         | 0.54 |
| Sticky Clay  | 0.23 |
| Bending      | 0.23 |

‚û°Ô∏è The AHP and QFD analysis revealed that **Huge Stones**, **Roots**, and **Dent formation** are critical areas to address for maximum quality impact.

### Six Sigma Improvement (Process Capability)

| Process Stage | Sigma Level (Pre-analysis) | Sigma Level (Post-analysis) |
|---------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Stage 1       | 3.59                       | 3.75                        |
| Stage 2       | 3.58                       | 3.72                        |
| Stage 3       | 3.63                       | 3.88                        |
| Stage 4       | 3.54                       | 3.64                        |
| **Overall**   | **3.50**                   | **3.74** üìà                |

‚úÖ After implementing recommended improvements, the company could potentially reach a **sigma level of 3.74**, up from 3.50, setting a new benchmark for quality performance.

## ‚úÖ Outcome and Recommendations

- Focus on raw material filtering to reduce huge stones and roots
- Adjust process parameters to minimize dent formation during drying
- Implement targeted inspection and monitoring at critical stages
- Continue DMAIC cycle and use AHP/QFD rankings for future prioritization
